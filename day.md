# Azure Networking Concepts

Today’s Azure workshop gave me a better understanding of some key networking concepts:

- **Azure Virtual Network (VNet):**  
  It’s like having your own private, secure space in the cloud where you can run resources like virtual machines and keep them connected.

- **IPv4 & IPv6:**  
  I learned about two types of IP addresses—IPv4, which is more commonly used, and IPv6, which offers a much larger address space to accommodate future internet growth.

- **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):**  
  This helps make managing IP addresses more efficient, like organizing them in a smarter, more streamlined way.

- **NAT Gateway:**  
  This feature allows resources inside a private network to access the internet for things like updates while keeping them safe from incoming traffic from the outside.

- **Bastion Hosts:**  
  Instead of exposing virtual machines to the public internet, these hosts provide secure, remote access, offering a safer way to manage VMs.
